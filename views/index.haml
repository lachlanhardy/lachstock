    %p I&rsquo;m the Startup Lead for Microsoft Australia. Basically that means my job is helping startups. With anything. I debug apps, web services, and business models. I&rsquo;ll help you find customers, employees or funding. Email me at <a href="mailto:lachlanh@microsoft.com">lachlanh@microsoft.com</a> to tell me about your business!

    %p I&rsquo;m a partner at an Ultimo, Sydney, coworking space called <a href="http://theworkben.ch">The Workbench</a>. I work there a few days a week (when I'm in Sydney), especially Fridays for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=laksafriday">Laksa Friday</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fridayat4">#fridayat4</a>.

    %p I help <a href="http://twitter.com/twalve">Craig Sharkie</a> run the <a href="http://sydjs.com/">SydJS group</a> for Sydney&rsquo;s JavaScripters and I&rsquo;m a regular in the <a href="http://ruby.org.au">Australian Ruby scene</a> where I can be heard arguing the benefits of various open technologies and practices at the occasional <a href="http://ruby.org.au/meetups/syd.html">Sydney meeting</a> and any <a href="http://railscamps.net/">Railscamp</a>. I also helped <a href="http://rubyconf.org.au/news#talking-heads">select the talks</a> for <a href="http://rubyconf.org.au/">RubyConfAU 2014</a>.

    %p I&rsquo;m a web standardista from way back (I ran the <a href="http://webstandardsgroup.org">Web Standards Group</a> meetings in Melbourne from 2004-2006) and gave presentations at <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/resources/lachlan-hardy-the-open-web/">Web Directions South</a>, Edge of the Web, Microsoft&rsquo;s REMIX10 and New Zealand&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/10/">Webstock</a> conference on the topic of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lachlanhardy/the-open-web-3228466">The Open Web</a>.

    %p With support from some amazing people, I used to run an industry event called Webjam to provide a platform for people to show off their innovations built on the web and web technologies.

    %p I&rsquo;m a passionate advocate of open web technologies but I try to temper that by actually knowing about those technologies &mdash; preferably from having used them.

    %p I&rsquo;m available for coffee, drinks, lunch, and hearing about <strong>you</strong>.
