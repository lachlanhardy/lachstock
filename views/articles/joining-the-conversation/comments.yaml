        <p>Cheers!  I know exactly how you feel.  Same thing happened to me at SXSWi2005.  In almost the exact same way…Flickr account, addiction, blog, first post, not knowing what I&rsquo;d write about…but damn sure that I wasn&rsquo;t just going to take&#133;that I must know something that I could give back.</p>
        <p>So&#133;thanks for joining the conversation and giving us a view that is uniquely Lach.</p>

        <p>I like the idea of &lsquo;giving something back&rsquo;. I think that&rsquo;s really important in any community, but I hadn&rsquo;t thought of doing it via a blog.</p>
        <p>As you can see, I&rsquo;m giving something back by not having any content on my site - still!</p>
        <p>Perhaps all that is about to change.</p>
        <p>Great first article Lachlan, I really can&rsquo;t wait to see more and I know they&rsquo;re going to be great. You have so much passion for this web stuff ;)</p>

        <p>I like how you&rsquo;ve worn your artistic influences on your sleeve and gone for the Mondrian stark boxes, contrasting negative and positive space with sparse flourishes of colour.</p>
        <p>You&rsquo;ve depths I never knew you had!</p>
