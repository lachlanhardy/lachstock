    %p Cheers!  I know exactly how you feel.  Same thing happened to me at SXSWi2005.  In almost the exact same way…Flickr account, addiction, blog, first post, not knowing what I’d write about…but damn sure that I wasn’t just going to take…that I must know something that I could give back.
    %p So…thanks for joining the conversation and giving us a view that is uniquely Lach.

    %p I like the idea of ‘giving something back’. I think that’s really important in any community, but I hadn’t thought of doing it via a blog.
    %p As you can see, I’m giving something back by not having any content on my site - still!
    %p Perhaps all that is about to change.
    %p Great first article Lachlan, I really can’t wait to see more and I know they’re going to be great. You have so much passion for this web stuff ;)

    %p I like how you’ve worn your artistic influences on your sleeve and gone for the Mondrian stark boxes, contrasting negative and positive space with sparse flourishes of colour.
    %p You’ve depths I never knew you had!

    %p Can you feel the love in the room?
    %p Thanks, folks, you rock!
    %p Cam… What’s a Mondria?
    %p Ben, I reckon you’re looking for Lachlan Hunt ;)
