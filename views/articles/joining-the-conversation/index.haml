%p This has been a long time coming. I&rsquo;ve always followed the conversation. I read every site. I scoured the web for content as an increasingly voracious consumer. I stuffed more and more of everything into my brain and I couldn&rsquo;t get enough.
%p Then I got the agency job. One that had me slaving 14-18 hours most days to produce slick high-quality standards-compliant accessible websites, usually for government departments. I never installed a feed reader on my new machine. I never had time.
%p Work was my life until Web Essentials in 2005. Everybody there was talking about <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, telling me it was a revolution. A new kind of application. A new form of online community. A new paradigm!
%p I scoffed at them like any other sensible person does when faced with such fervent reverence. But, after the conference, I looked at the photos and I wanted to comment&hellip; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/glutnix/47989722/">Trapped!</a> Once I had an account, it seemed almost churlish not to post at least one photo. This started a long term <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lachlanhardy">obsession with photography</a>, mostly self-involved.
%p More importantly, it started an attitude of experimentation, a willingness to sign up for any and every app that comes along. To subscribe to every feed, for at least a little while. It also meant that, after a while, I was actually giving back. Producing content and contributing in some small measure to both sides of the signal/noise ratio.
%p And then there was <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>&hellip;
%p I&rsquo;ve been writing <a href="http://twitter.com/lachlanhardy/">small blips of bollocks</a> there since October sometime (actually it was <a href="http://twitter.com/lachlanhardy/statuses/49501">10:53 AM October 27, 2006</a>). And, for some reason, I can&rsquo;t stop.
%p I love putting ideas out there. I love discussion and interaction. I love sharing my thoughts, then watching my thoughts and your thoughts grow and commingle.
%p In 2005, <a href="http://molly.com">Molly Holzschlag</a> told me I needed a blog, so I asked her what I should write. Being the woman she is, Molly said: “Everything!” Since that time, others have suggested it occasionally and I&rsquo;ve always asked the same question. Their answers vary dramatically and that was my excuse for not building this site. I never knew what I would write about, and I still don&rsquo;t. But I am going to write.
%p My hand has been forced by one of my favourite evil geniuses, <a href="http://leftjustified.net/">Andrew Krespanis</a>. The sneaky bugger slaved away for weeks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrew_k/404554243/">give me LachStock as a gift</a>. Aided and abetted by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lisaherrod/404554886">a secret squirrel pact</a>, he left me <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lisaherrod/tags/lachlanseesthesite/">totally overwhelmed</a>.
%p I still don&rsquo;t know how to say thank you for that gift. I&rsquo;m not even sure that is possible. The only appropriate response is to do this, and do it right. So, after 6 years of living, breathing and talking web, I&rsquo;m finally making some web of my own. I&rsquo;m joining the conversation I&rsquo;ve followed for so long. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll be writing or where it will take us, but, fuck, I reckon it&rsquo;ll be fun!
