  .item_content
    %p This has been a long time coming. I’ve always followed the conversation. I read every site. I scoured the web for content as an increasingly voracious consumer. I stuffed more and more of everything into my brain and I couldn’t get enough.
    %p Then I got the agency job. One that had me slaving 14-18 hours most days to produce slick high-quality standards-compliant accessible websites, usually for government departments. I never installed a feed reader on my new machine. I never had time.
    %p
      Work was my life until Web Essentials in 2005. Everybody there was talking about
      %a{:href => "http://flickr.com/"} Flickr
      , telling me it was a revolution. A new kind of application. A new form of online community. A new paradigm!
    %p
      I scoffed at them like any other sensible person does when faced with such fervent reverence. But, after the conference, I looked at the photos and I wanted to comment…
      %a{ :href => "http://www.flickr.com/photos/glutnix/47989722/" } Trapped!
      Once I had an account, it seemed almost churlish not to post at least one photo. This started a long term
      %a{ :href => "http://flickr.com/photos/lachlanhardy" } obsession with photography
      , mostly self-involved.
    %p More importantly, it started an attitude of experimentation, a willingness to sign up for any and every app that comes along. To subscribe to every feed, for at least a little while. It also meant that, after a while, I was actually giving back. Producing content and contributing in some small measure to both sides of the signal/noise ratio.
    %p
      And then there was
      %a{ :href => "http://twitter.com/" } Twitter
      &#133;
    %p
      I’ve been writing
      %a{ :href => "http://twitter.com/lachlanhardy/" } small blips of bollocks
      there since October sometime (actually it was
      %a{ :href => "http://twitter.com/lachlanhardy/statuses/49501" } 10:53 AM October 27, 2006
      ). And, for some reason, I can’t stop.
    %p I love putting ideas out there. I love discussion and interaction. I love sharing my thoughts, then watching my thoughts and your thoughts grow and commingle.
    %p
      In 2005,
      %a{ :href => "http://molly.com" } Molly Holzschlag
      told me I needed a blog, so I asked her what I should write. Being the woman she is, Molly said: “Everything!” Since that time, others have suggested it occasionally and I’ve always asked the same question. Their answers vary dramatically and that was my excuse for not building this site. I never knew what I would write about, and I still don’t. But I am going to write.
    %p
      My hand has been forced by one of my favourite evil geniuses,
      %a{:href => "http://leftjustified.net/"} Andrew Krespanis
      \. The sneaky bugger slaved away for weeks to
      %a{:href => "http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrew_k/404554243/"} give me LachStock as a gift
      \. Aided and abetted by
      %a{:href => "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lisaherrod/404554886"} a secret squirrel pact
      , he left me
      %a{:href => "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lisaherrod/tags/lachlanseesthesite/"} totally overwhelmed
      \.
    %p I still don’t know how to say thank you for that gift. I’m not even sure that is possible. The only appropriate response is to do this, and do it right. So, after 6 years of living, breathing and talking web, I’m finally making some web of my own. I’m joining the conversation I’ve followed for so long. I don’t know what I’ll be writing or where it will take us, but, fuck, I reckon it’ll be fun!

        %p Cheers!  I know exactly how you feel.  Same thing happened to me at SXSWi2005.  In almost the exact same way…Flickr account, addiction, blog, first post, not knowing what I’d write about…but damn sure that I wasn’t just going to take…that I must know something that I could give back.
        %p So…thanks for joining the conversation and giving us a view that is uniquely Lach.

        %p I like the idea of ‘giving something back’. I think that’s really important in any community, but I hadn’t thought of doing it via a blog.
        %p As you can see, I’m giving something back by not having any content on my site - still!
        %p Perhaps all that is about to change.
        %p Great first article Lachlan, I really can’t wait to see more and I know they’re going to be great. You have so much passion for this web stuff ;)

        %p I like how you’ve worn your artistic influences on your sleeve and gone for the Mondrian stark boxes, contrasting negative and positive space with sparse flourishes of colour.
