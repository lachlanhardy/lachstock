        <p>Thanks a lot, DG! I had a ball.</p>
        <p>Thanks very much, Bronwen! I&rsquo;m really glad you enjoyed it. We all have a dark side - I&rsquo;m sure yours is equally impressive, but I&rsquo;m happy to run with the nice one!</p>

        <p>Hey there,</p>
        <p>Just wanted to say you guys turned what I thought would be a massively boring session into one that really rocked. Whilst, sure, you didn&rsquo;t sway me towards using IE8 all that much, you definetly taught me a thing or two about web standards and making my websites much better, both from a development pov and a design one.</p>
        <p>Out of all of the sessions that day, yours made the biggest impression on me, and not just because it was in a platform I could understand, but also because you both presented it in a forward, honest method.</p>
        <p>So thanks for the awesome session!</p>
        <p>Regards,</p>

        <p>That&rsquo;s fantastic, David, thanks very much! I&rsquo;m glad we were able make an impression. I&rsquo;m only sorry we didn&rsquo;t have more time left for your questions (which were not git-ish in the slightest).</p>
        <p>Feel free to hit me up with any further questions!</p>

        <p>Did your IE8 talk mention the IE8b <a href="http://css-class.com/test/bugs/ie/ie-bugs.htm">CSS bugs</a>?</p>
        <p>A much improved rendering engine, just a few bugs to iron out.</p>
        <p>I may one day turn up at one of those web conferences.</p>
        <p>BTW, how is Sydney life. I live just up the freeway from you on the sunny Central Coast.</p>
