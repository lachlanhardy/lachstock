If you wanted to push this further, I’m sure John and Maxine wouldn’t mind plugging this bulk order opportunity on the Web Directions blog&hellip;

Big ups for making noise about this Lachlan.
%p
Don’t worry about this backfiring and people getting narky with you.  If anyone does they need to harden the fuck up or stop being an early adopter.
%p
If one really decides that Meraki is not for them just flick the switch and recover some of the costs on eBay or something.  Simple.
%p
Hazaah!

Shame just missed out on the last Canberra WSG meet, but I’ll be sure to make sure it gets a mention at the next one!

Thanks Lachlan for making the noise.
%p
I’ve ordered 4, not because
%strong
I
need 4, but so that I can use 2 and hand 1 or 2 to a neighbour.
%p
We are going to be one of the 1st houses in a new development soon and this seems to be a perfect application of the Merakis: make friends with the new neighbours by giving them free wifi internet!
%p
A couple of outdoor models in the future to provide access in the public parks and spaces, and instant wifi neighbourhood here we come.

@Kevin Good idea! And what about SitePoint, eh? Or, indeed, your personal blog ;)
%p
@Lucas I’m not complaining. I just wanted to point out that I don’t have all the answers. None of us have ever done this before, so there are bound to be some issues. It’s about recognising that, preparing for it and fighting on.
%p
Meraki are a means to an end. There are others, I just happen to think they’re our best bet right now
%p
@Nat I’ll be bringing it up tomorrow night at the Sydney meet for sure

What do you think about the idea of devising a user friendly name that we all use for the network?
Something that helps people identify ‘the movement’ and clearly labels it as free and for the community. Would this help people to realise you’re sharing for the greater good and that they’re not just leaching free wifi off a noobie set up… Would that in some small way help to raise awareness?

@Lisa Not sure I understand your suggestion fully, but I believe the default SSID of the public-tier network is “freethenet” …

We’re jumping in Lach Stock and Two Smoking Merakis. Yes this is frontier work. Yes it is scary. Yes your ISP might not appreciate you sharing.
%p
All that is what makes it fun.
%p
This really is our opportunity to bootstrap Sydney (and Melbourne, Perth, c’mon the rest of you!) into the free wifi we all want but haven’t been able to find so far.
%p
Remember - networks are exponentially more useful with each additional user!

After I get my 2 nodes in place, I looking at trying to at least connect up the local suburb. Maybe a little line of sight boosting the signal between nodes with a third party antenna.  Everyone I have spoken to about this is very excited.  As expected they don’t want to be first.

Gary, same idea here; run it for a bit - then do a leaflet drop for 100 metres around my house … then try and get other people to get in on it with their own nodes. Being the only 2-storey house for a couple of hundred metres is going to be an advantage here!!

Great initiative, I will ask Myles if we can get a couple for our office in West Perth and home as well - but will be interested to see how they work and if they are all sold out - will be up for a round 2 after all of you have tested and have the answers.

Hi Lachlan,
I’ve had a small Meraki mesh (27 users) operating for about 3 months (see: http://public.meraki.com/network/Jane_Street). But now I’ve dismantled it and I’d like to sell the two minis.
These are Legacy Edition minis which means that they are same same as the latest Pro Edition but without the annoying Message Bar etc.
That’s the advantage. The disadvantage is that they have EU power packs. This means that although the Voltage is OK you need EU to Aussie plug adaptors.
Would you know anyone wanting to buy them at cost price plus postage?
Ciao,
John

It would be interesting to get stat’s from others running meraki networks in Oz. Wondering what sort of take up they have had, traffic usage, number of users etc.
%p
Got my network going this evening &amp; had my first user within 30mins, they did about 20mb traffic over the next 2 hours and disappeared. Very happy.

The Canadian FreeTheNet guys in Vancouver are open sourcing a new flash OS for the Merakis that does away with the toolbar (and the need to link to Meraki HQ).  Version 1.0 as about 2 days ago: http://groups.google.com/group/freethenet-ca
