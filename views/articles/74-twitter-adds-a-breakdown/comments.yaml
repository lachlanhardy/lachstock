        <p>obsessive - Nah.  But I do process new adds via filtering in a similar one on one basis.</p>

        <p>I veto every follower request based on whether or not I know the person. If I’ve met them, or have interacted with them on-line they’re in. If I haven’t then they’re out.</p>
        <p>I find that most of the “people” that I reject are following thousands of others but are followed only by a handful. Bots I guess.</p>
        <p>Funnily enough when I signed up for twitter I wrote simply “Enthusiast” as my bio with my toungue held firmly in my cheek.</p>

        <p>Not sure if you’ve seen/used Quotably. A pretty interesting tool to see what’s going on beyond the simple username. Do they engage, do they converse etc…..Fun to ‘see’</p>

        <p>Thinking about using Greasemonkey to apply some of the filters you’ve mentioned. Some Real People&trade; don’t warrant continuous following but are too much fun to ditch completely.</p>

        <p>I’ve taken what I’m starting to call “The Facebook Approach”. I generally ignore the notifications and just treat it as a sort of game to see how high the number gets.</p>
        <p>I’m pretty sure I’ve got pending invites from people I do actually know (or more likely I met at some web thing one time). But with the disconnect between Twitter names/bios and real identities, I have NFI which ones they are.</p>
        <p>I really think Twitter needs groups/filters. I follow some people who are tremendously high traffic Twitters and I can’t/won’t/don’t read everything they post. But, they periodically address me directly so I don’t really want to ditch them.</p>
        <p>That’s it! Everyone onto Pownce ;)</p>

        <p>It’s interesting to see the various ways you guys react to the need to filter (including Ben who just ignores it). I feel the need to keep control of them, so I can’t take his route. And I don’t want to miss out on potentially interesting people just because I don’t know them.</p>
        <p>I’ve met some great folks via Twitter - many of whom I’ve not met in person yet, but have interacted with on various increasing levels. It’s definitely a great way to find cool folks who are interested in similar stuff!</p>

        <p>I’ve taken to using a script to save a list of followers so I can see who’s added me, and then doing a “following:updates” ratio.  Anyone who just listens (total lurker) with little or nothing to say gets blocked.  Also, anyone with no bio, or other anonymity gets blocked.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I started following 1000monkeys which is like a fun-house mirror bot.</p>

        <p>That’s an interesting method, Jim. I still just do all mine manually. It doesn’t take a long time to check folks out. And I don’t get enough adds that I really <em>need</em> to automate it.</p>
        <p>I do love 1000monkeys too. I think Andrew Tetlaw built that. He’s a devilishly clever fellow!</p>

        <p>To be honest, I used to look at every single person as they added me to see who they were and if I wanted to follow them back (I never block unless they’re inappropriate). Then a couple months ago, twitter decided that every email I own (6 different domains) didn’t work (yes, of course they do). And I no longer get any notification. I filed a ticket on it, but nothing’s happened.</p>
        <p>This means that I have to remember to go in and see who has followed recently (which with Mr. Tweet can be a whole lot). So I’ve gotten rather slack because I’ve been busy lately. I glance and if I recognize them I follow. But until the weekends when I have time to click every single one, I don’t really see who’s there.</p>
        <p>As a rule, I follow people I know, people I want to know (have heard of), people that are interesting regarding my industry and people that are funny as crap. :)  I don’t see a point in blocking the others since I don’t even know they’re there if I don’t follow them. Maybe I’m silly.</p>
        <p>It was great to spend time with you last week Lachlan! :)</p>
