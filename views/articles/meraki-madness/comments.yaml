        <p>Big ups for making noise about this Lachlan.</p>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about this backfiring and people getting narky with you.  If anyone does they need to harden the fuck up or stop being an early adopter.</p>
        <p>If one really decides that Meraki is not for them just flick the switch and recover some of the costs on eBay or something.  Simple.</p>
        <p>Hazaah!</p>

        <p>Thanks Lachlan for making the noise. </p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve ordered 4, not because <strong>I</strong> need 4, but so that I can use 2 and hand 1 or 2 to a neighbour.</p>
        <p>We are going to be one of the 1st houses in a new development soon and this seems to be a perfect application of the Merakis: make friends with the new neighbours by giving them free wifi internet!</p>
        <p>A couple of outdoor models in the future to provide access in the public parks and spaces, and instant wifi neighbourhood here we come.</p>

        <p>@Kevin Good idea! And what about SitePoint, eh? Or, indeed, your personal blog ;)</p>
        <p>@Lucas I&rsquo;m not complaining. I just wanted to point out that I don&rsquo;t have all the answers. None of us have ever done this before, so there are bound to be some issues. It&rsquo;s about recognising that, preparing for it and fighting on.</p>
        <p>Meraki are a means to an end. There are others, I just happen to think they&rsquo;re our best bet right now</p>
        <p>@Nat I&rsquo;ll be bringing it up tomorrow night at the Sydney meet for sure</p>

        <p>What do you think about the idea of devising a user friendly name that we all use for the network?</p>
        <p>Something that helps people identify &lsquo;the movement&rsquo; and clearly labels it as free and for the community. Would this help people to realise you&rsquo;re sharing for the greater good and that they&rsquo;re not just leaching free wifi off a noobie set up… Would that in some small way help to raise awareness?</p>

        <p>@Lisa Not sure I understand your suggestion fully, but I believe the default SSID of the public-tier network is “freethenet” &hellip;</p>

        <p>We&rsquo;re jumping in Lach Stock and Two Smoking Merakis. Yes this is frontier work. Yes it is scary. Yes your ISP might not appreciate you sharing.</p>
        <p>All that is what makes it fun.</p>
        <p>This really is our opportunity to bootstrap Sydney (and Melbourne, Perth, c&rsquo;mon the rest of you!) into the free wifi we all want but haven&rsquo;t been able to find so far.</p>
        <p>Remember - networks are exponentially more useful with each additional user!</p>

        <p>After I get my 2 nodes in place, I looking at trying to at least connect up the local suburb. Maybe a little line of sight boosting the signal between nodes with a third party antenna.  Everyone I have spoken to about this is very excited.  As expected they don&rsquo;t want to be first.</p>

        <p>Gary, same idea here; run it for a bit - then do a leaflet drop for 100 metres around my house … then try and get other people to get in on it with their own nodes. Being the only 2-storey house for a couple of hundred metres is going to be an advantage here!!</p>

        <p>I put in an order for 26 Indoor and 5 Outdoor yesterday, so there will be plenty of folks in Melbourne and Sydney playing with them soon.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s going to be really interesting to see where this takes us!</p>

        <p>Great initiative, I will ask Myles if we can get a couple for our office in West Perth and home as well - but will be interested to see how they work and if they are all sold out - will be up for a round 2 after all of you have tested and have the answers.</p>

        <p>Hi Lachlan,</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve had a small Meraki mesh (27 users) operating for about 3 months (see: http://public.meraki.com/network/Jane_Street). But now I&rsquo;ve dismantled it and I&rsquo;d like to sell the two minis.</p>
        <p>These are Legacy Edition minis which means that they are same same as the latest Pro Edition but without the annoying Message Bar etc. That&rsquo;s the advantage. The disadvantage is that they have EU power packs. This means that although the Voltage is OK you need EU to Aussie plug adaptors.</p>
        <p>Would you know anyone wanting to buy them at cost price plus postage?</p>
        <p>Ciao,</p>
        <p>John</p>

        <p>It would be interesting to get stat&rsquo;s from others running meraki networks in Oz. Wondering what sort of take up they have had, traffic usage, number of users etc.</p>
        <p>Got my network going this evening &amp; had my first user within 30mins, they did about 20mb traffic over the next 2 hours and disappeared. Very happy.</p>

        <p>The Canadian FreeTheNet guys in Vancouver are open sourcing a new flash OS for the Merakis that does away with the toolbar (and the need to link to Meraki HQ).  Version 1.0 as about 2 days ago: http://groups.google.com/group/freethenet-ca</p>
