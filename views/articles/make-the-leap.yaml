  All leaps are relative I suppose. I think after the first leap the next one seems a bit less scary than it did before. So you do that one too…

  Agreed, taking a plunge 18 months ago was one of the best decisions I made too. Granted, I didn’t move cities, but those leaps get harder the more personal responsibilities you take on board. But that doesn’t mean you should stop taking ‘em. Just requires a bit more deliberation and approval from “the boss” ;-)

  Great stuff, +vely inspiring.
  Reminds me of the jumps I made for a better life down-under and to forget the “how the hell did I end up here” times.

  It’s inspiring to read that post, Lachlan.
%p
  I made the jump of quitting my job in Perth and moving to Melbourne too, no safety net, hardly knowing anyone.
%p
  That was over 8 years ago now, and I’ve never looked back.
%p
  Sometimes that gut feeling to leap without looking is the one that is right, and while things can take some time to settle down, risk is something all of us should try at some time, if only for the life experience.

  Well I think that people who strive for greatness will never stop. Even if they reached their goal they will find new Goals. The best example ist this Fosset guy who got lost in the wild yesterday. He constantly comes up with new cracy ideas together with Richard Brandson. Ghandi had a great success in Afrika and what did he do? Stay there and enjoy his victory? No! He continued with an even more difficult task - he went to India.

  Congrats, Lachlan. I think I said to you before, you and Lisa are just the cutest couple ever and hearing the things you say about each other all the time makes me proud to know you both.

  It’s been just over a year since Dave and I quit our jobs and started Clever Starfish, and I know without a doubt that taking that risk was the best thing we’ve ever done.

  Peter, I also think that great people do not stop. Its funny but they show Alexander on TV right now and he is also a great example. I think the Biography on Benjamin Franklin is also supposed to be inspiring.

  Thank you for the inspiring words. I had some motivational problems. I have read your article last weekend and it really inspired me. I actually managed to get going again. I think it is important to constantly move forward twards your goal. Even if sometimes it is difficult and it goes slow - just keep moving.
