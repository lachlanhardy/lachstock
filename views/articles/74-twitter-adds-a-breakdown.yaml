%p obsessive - Nah.  But I do process new adds via filtering in a similar one on one basis.

  I veto every follower request based on whether or not I know the person. If I’ve met them, or have interacted with them on-line they’re in. If I haven’t then they’re out.
%p
  I find that most of the “people” that I reject are following thousands of others but are followed only by a handful. Bots I guess.
%p
  Funnily enough when I signed up for twitter I wrote simply “Enthusiast” as my bio with my toungue held firmly in my cheek.

  Not sure if you’ve seen/used Quotably. A pretty interesting tool to see what’s going on beyond the simple username. Do they engage, do they converse etc…..Fun to ‘see’

  Thinking about using Greasemonkey to apply some of the filters you’ve mentioned. Some Real People&trade; don’t warrant continuous following but are too much fun to ditch completely.

  I’ve taken what I’m starting to call “The Facebook Approach”. I generally ignore the notifications and just treat it as a sort of game to see how high the number gets.
%p
  I’m pretty sure I’ve got pending invites from people I do actually know (or more likely I met at some web thing one time). But with the disconnect between Twitter names/bios and real identities, I have NFI which ones they are.
%p
  I really think Twitter needs groups/filters. I follow some people who are tremendously high traffic Twitters and I can’t/won’t/don’t read everything they post. But, they periodically address me directly so I don’t really want to ditch them.
%p
  That’s it! Everyone onto Pownce ;)

  It’s interesting to see the various ways you guys react to the need to filter (including Ben who just ignores it). I feel the need to keep control of them, so I can’t take his route. And I don’t want to miss out on potentially interesting people just because I don’t know them.
%p
  I’ve met some great folks via Twitter - many of whom I’ve not met in person yet, but have interacted with on various increasing levels. It’s definitely a great way to find cool folks who are interested in similar stuff!

  I’ve taken to using a script to save a list of followers so I can see who’s added me, and then doing a “following:updates” ratio.  Anyone who just listens (total lurker) with little or nothing to say gets blocked.  Also, anyone with no bio, or other anonymity gets blocked.
%p
  On the other hand, I started following 1000monkeys which is like a fun-house mirror bot.

  That’s an interesting method, Jim. I still just do all mine manually. It doesn’t take a long time to check folks out. And I don’t get enough adds that I really
  %em
    need
  to automate it.
%p
  I do love 1000monkeys too. I think Andrew Tetlaw built that. He’s a devilishly clever fellow!

%p To be honest, I used to look at every single person as they added me to see who they were and if I wanted to follow them back (I never block unless they’re inappropriate). Then a couple months ago, twitter decided that every email I own (6 different domains) didn’t work (yes, of course they do). And I no longer get any notification. I filed a ticket on it, but nothing’s happened.
%p This means that I have to remember to go in and see who has followed recently (which with Mr. Tweet can be a whole lot). So I’ve gotten rather slack because I’ve been busy lately. I glance and if I recognize them I follow. But until the weekends when I have time to click every single one, I don’t really see who’s there.
%p As a rule, I follow people I know, people I want to know (have heard of), people that are interesting regarding my industry and people that are funny as crap. :)  I don’t see a point in blocking the others since I don’t even know they’re there if I don’t follow them. Maybe I’m silly.
%p It was great to spend time with you last week Lachlan! :)
%p Stef.
