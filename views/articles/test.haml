    %p This has been a long time coming. I’ve always followed the conversation. I read every site. I scoured the web for content as an increasingly voracious consumer. I stuffed more and more of everything into my brain and I couldn’t get enough.
    %p Then I got the agency job. One that had me slaving 14-18 hours most days to produce slick high-quality standards-compliant accessible websites, usually for government departments. I never installed a feed reader on my new machine. I never had time.

        %p Cheers!  I know exactly how you feel.  Same thing happened to me at SXSWi2005.  In almost the exact same way…Flickr account, addiction, blog, first post, not knowing what I’d write about…but damn sure that I wasn’t just going to take…that I must know something that I could give back.
        %p So…thanks for joining the conversation and giving us a view that is uniquely Lach.
