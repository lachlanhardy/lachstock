You gave a fantastic presentation, a brilliant end to the conference which only as good as it was due to all the great presenters who came on board.
%p
I really hope we see more local governments adopting the Open Web philosophy and maybe we’ll see an API available before too long!
%p
Thanks so much for being apart of our conference,
Diana

P.S I’ll let you know as soon as the podcast is up!

Thanks for the kind words and a great prezo from you also!

I’ve drifted from the more technical side of standards for a while, so it was a great return to my ‘old roots’. Good for me to reconnect with a kindred web spirit.

Unfortunately this is going to come across as biased, but honestly, Lachlan’s presentation was the best I’ve seen in ages.
%p
Make the time to watch it, it’s worth it. You will not ask for your 50 minutes back.

I enjoyed your presentation Lachlan. I look forward to the day when we get to implement more of the open web technologies in Aussie government.

Great capture of John’s quotes - I particularly love the second one…

Great preso mate. Makes me miss the passion of the Sydney scene which, believe me, is world world class.

Nice to see what is possible with the world wide web. I wish that all people and all institutions would work in that way. Because with the world wide web so many things, so many good things possible. There are so many options with the web and the internet. So let us all come together to make it more popular, so that we can take more advantages of the world wide web.
