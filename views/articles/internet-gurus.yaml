We’re only scratching the surface of what happens when more and more people are permanently online and mobile.  Think of the subtle but profound ways we changed socially when mobile phones went from novelty yuppy fashion statement to dull ubiquity. That’s going to happen again with mobile data.

  Twitter - because it gives me instant access the the people and minds I want to be invovled with. Their is no ranking. Youtube - still excites me due it’s ability to create specialised forums.As time goes by Youtube is getting deeper into the ‘long tail’ and creating greater value to people at the micro level of desires. Blogging - still the best way for opinions and knowldege to be shared and transfered and it continues to bust down traditional power structures.
%li
%p
  My wallet - as this still has more technology in it than my phone and is at this stage still more useful than my iphone. Occassionally the iphone stays home, but it gets a run 90% of the time. I’m hoping soon it will become a digital wallet that does all.
%li
%p
  The next big thing is transition of the web to focus on mobile devices from the4 current desk / lap focus. The iphone is just the start. A netscape equivalent. Most important innovation on the web will be about mobile devices - think live visual recognitions, holographic images, expanding scroll screens and stuff we haven’t even thought of.

Mobile phone obviously. Connection to family: I’m a parent, I must always be able to be contacted. I believe, though cannot know, that whenever I have an iPhone I will carry it also for Web, for connection to my social networks; right now, I am disconnected when not at home.My current phone – Nokia E65 – doesn’t fulfil that role, because 3G connection is irregular and the experience is crappy enough to make it not worthwhile.
%li
Mobile definitely. Perhaps the place that Apple is going with the combination of interface and connectivity that the iPhone is the start of … OR some smaller, cheaper device that provides MSN-like chat and sharing for teh teens.

Congratulations on your guru status, mate! It’s a good piece, and for what it’s worth, here’s my 2 pence:
%ol
%li
%ul
  %li
    Twitter for its simplicity, tiny barrier to participation and ability to force brevity in 140 chars or less. (This comment would not exist without it.)
  %li
    Flickr, still, because I can still evangelise it to everyone I know (especially non-techies) and have them &ldquo;get&rdquo; it.
  %li
    The acceleration of the science of design being applied to the Web; typography in particular, with all the amazing grace it radiates.
%li
My iPhone. Many things about being permanently available, connected and present in the social space unnerve me. Many things about the iPhone bug me (literally). However, the ease with which the device enables me to connect with people and information is still surprising me; it’s a symptom of age, but long may it continue. For our kids, the opposite will be true.
%li
The next big thing will be a personal revolution; true convergence of our data into our own self-determined domains and portable social networks. We will break out of the walled gardens and define ourselves and our lives with what we do, create, and observe.
%a{ :href => "http://dennajones.com" }
  Denna Jones’ site
is a step towards that: disparate text, media, thoughts, and actions from various sites controlled, owned and celebrated by the author as her identity. Geo/GPS services will be a part of that evolution as a catalyst, as will technologies like microformats, OAuth, and OpenID. They will all contribute to the death of traditional business models that attempts to own or control content, to the revisions we see happening today, where tools and services are monetised, but our content is ours to control, irrevocably.

1.Content owners and distributors were warned that the internet would decimate their business models; that the only way to survive would be to embrace the change. They didn’t. Already the interweb has dismantled the music industry and it’s revving up the chainsaw to drop the TV industry. After that, the internet will flip and pin the movie industry to the mat so quickly so fast you’ll have to replay it in slo-mo to see it happen. Lemme see: music industry, TV industry, movie industry… yep, that’s three things.

The fewer things I need to carry in my pockets, the better - the solution was never a man-bag or a belt clip, it was less stuff that does more. My iPhone is a better PDA than a dedicated PDA and yet also is so good at being my mobile browser, pocket gaming platform, photo album and portable TV/movie/music player as well that I’d have bought one for those reasons even if it weren’t a PDA, much less a phone. It’s so good because it hides complexity from the consumer and integrates so tightly with Macs and Apple TV.
%p
For example: if I’m not able to finish watching something on my AppleTV, when I watch it later on my iPhone (assuming it’s synced) it picks up from the point I stopped watching on the Apple TV. Glad I wasn’t on the team that had to make that work, but I love using a device that does such magical stuff with so little fanfare.

The Next Big Thing will Not Be What I Predict It To Be. Been around long enough to have the conclusive proof. But now I’m old enough to be allowed to not understand Kids These Days it doesn’t hurt so much so I’ll have one more stab at it: a NBT might be third-party APIs - APIs that aren’t associated with one product or company, but useful enough to enough products that they are conceived, designed, built and maintained either by an open community or by a company so light and fast that just providing a super useful API is a feasible business model. APIs are pure network effect.
%p
…either that, or the Next Big Thing will be the decreasing age at which you stop understanding Kids These Days and the average age of Kids. Pretty soon, 16 year olds will be complaining about Kids These Days. Twelve year olds will be creating the most exciting media, fashion, architecture and social changes.
%p
Generations will become so narrow that demographers will have to demarcate them by month of birth.
%p
“What you have to understand,” they’ll tell the 15 year old leaders of industry, “is that the generation of March, 2005 is radically different to the generation of April, 2005. You simply can’t expect the user-generated viral marketing mashups created by generation of April, 2005 to work on them.”
%p
Meanwhile, 17 year olds will be unable to get any cash out, reply to a message or reset a clock without help.

It’s the lappy. Whenever I have that thing by my side I know that I can bust out some code whenever inspiration hits. That’s something that my iPhone will never be able to do.

Agreeing with PatrickC, It’s the beginning of the end for windows based PCs. Critical mass within the generic population is just around the corner for apple.

  Someone clever and in touch is going to do something genuinely engaging in the area of geo location, life-streaming/self surveillance. I just tracked my path to work this morning with Path Tracks. Ok. Cool. But what’s next? Is there a genuine human need lurking in there somewhere waiting to be satisfied?

I think geolocation is going to be where the web gets it next big impetus.  Semantic web is all well and good, but a) impossible and b) it’s still just better organised stuff that’s already there. Geoweb ties the web to real life and the physical world and makes it an extension of our lives.It requires GPS or smart location technologies to tag everything, and mobile web to get it back out when you are out and about.

1a - Google Apps - I know this is old, but it’s one of the key parts of making my online life manageable. About 1.5 year back I consolidated all my e-mail accounts under one account at Google. Later I also moved to Google Reader and the other online services. Adding NuveaSync sync to the mix and you got push calendar and contacts to your iPhone, via Google. Awesomeness!
%p
1b - Silverlight 2 - It’s an awesome development platform and I’m excited about what’s to come.
%p
1c - Sites with APIs, integration points and movable data.
%p
2 - My iPhone. Got the first gen phone, bought in the US, so I’m missing out on online services (the Vodaphone GPRS plan is a piece of shit!). But other than that it’s an awesome device. Now that I got wireless (when on wlan) sync from my GCal it’s all good!
%p
3 - Silverlight based business apps backed by some cloud infrastructure from Google, Amazon or Microsoft - well at least it would be cool. It’s definitely NOT a new Twitter clone! Perhaps FireEagle and location services finally will take off?

    I agree about google apps, I was just raving about them on Tim Bull’s blog yesterday, I replaced a bunch of PITA mail server management with a couple of google apps accounts and it’s made my life much easier and my mail and calendar more portable (ditched Outlook, use webmail and blackberry)
  %li
    Evernote is a newish tool for me, keeping notes and my personal knowledgebase and links in sync across multiple PCs is awesome.
  %li
    Twitter (I’ll join the crowd on that one), it’s gone from silly gimmick to a decent way to keep in touch with friends to a great way to actually expand my network and find new people. I held out on the last one until recently and only followed people I knew. The more i lean in to Twitter, the more a part of my life it has become.
  %li
    special mention. Ning! I run a few networks on Ning and it’s a great platform that lets me do things I otherwise never would have found the time to build.
%li
%p
  My Blackberry Curve. I’m a holdout on the iPhone, and I know I’m missing the 3G, Better browsing and the decent camera of the N95. But as a messaging platform it’s amazing, gives me enough web access to keep in touch and has my calendar and contacts in sync. Waiting for something better, not sure whether that will be a Nokia, new BB or maybe something Androidish.
%li
%p
  Palmtop computing, next gen phones. We’re nearly there, if you took the best bits of the current smartphone offerings, fixed up the battery life and had decently priced bandwidth, plus decent syncing to the cloud and desktop we’d be close. An open API to hook in location based services, and the ability to “friend” people wirelessly and tag them with the location and time you met them… ooh, there’s a startup idea right there.

What are the three things online that are exciting you most?
%p
The possibilities of mobile personal web servers is still blowing my mind. Waiting for the internal mindstorm to calm down so I can articulate why it will change everything.
%p
Easy mobile web access cannot be underestimated. Devices like the iPhone and Meraki work in tandem to open our eyes to that previously invisible layer of data that surrounds us.
%p
FireEagle and friends - location services. These will become serendipity enablers, allowing you to bump into friends when you’re in the same square kilometre, where previously you needed to be in line of sight (and even then you didn’t always connect.)
%p
What gadget do you never leave home without?
%p
Phone. Nokia E65 now, but it will always have access to the web and a camera. Most likely an iPhone later in the year. Why? I need to see the internet that surrounds us, especially being able to see the internet as it is relevant to where I am or what I’m doing.
%p
What will be the Next Big Thing?
%p
Location, location, location.

1) Twitter (www.twitter.com) is still one of the tools on the web that I get excited about when describing the concept of penetrative micro-blogging. 12seconds.tv (www.12seconds.tv) is a model I’m really interested in at the moment, I’m exploring it and monitoring it’s progress. Soocial (www.soocial.com), very simple, easily adoptive and has saved my ass on occasion already
%p
2) My n95. I didn’t rate it, but a recent firmware upgrade, and an eagerness to prove it’s worth before I get an iPhone has now resulted in it being the first slap check in the “phone, keys, wallet, 3 slap check”. I do not leave home without it.
%p
3) For me it’s all about location location location. Brightkite has made a significant step in the right direction, but it’s lacking personal feedback. “It says nothing to me about my life”. With the adoption rate of geo-location aware personal devices steadily increasing I believe that in 2 years time we’ll become less of aware of where in the world we are, but more aware of what is happening and available around us through these devices.

I’m in awe of all these amazing responses! Thank you.

In particular, I love that with so many people responding, the differences are still so great. There are stalwarts like Twitter and location-based services, but the sheer range of things of interest to all of you who have chosen to comment is exciting in itself!

Certainly a good list of responses so far… but I might add:
%ol
%li
What are the three things online that are exciting you most?
%p
I’m big into seeing the building blocks for the open web emerge to support identity, socializing/safer sharing and location/presence.
%p
Obviously things I work on like OpenID and OAuth are contributing here, but that’s only because there’s been such a flurry of innovation in these areas that gives me cause to try to commoditize some of these activities with standardized protocols!
%p
I’m also a big fan of Brightkite and mining of self-data (see Wesabe, RescueTime, Last.fm, Bedposted, etc).
%ol
%li
What gadget do you never leave home without? And given most everybody will say their phone or their laptop, why?
%p
I’ll stick with the safe answer and go with my “breakthru internet device” – aka my iPhone. ;)
%p
I love iPhone-friendly web apps (Brightkite is among the best). It gives me a sense for where the web is going on mobile devices (thanks to mobile Safari) and also where it needs to go and needs to improve (interactivity, preventing crashes, authorization, account management, identity, etc).
%ol
%li
What will be the Next Big Thing?
%p
There are few “next big things” left, unless you radically shrink your conception of “big”. Many popular things are now niche-popular, and that’s fine. The Dark Knight is a rare exception, I think.
%p
That said, I do think location is going to take off in a major way – and will become yet another thing developers can “take for granted”. And that’s big.
%p
Another “widespread” trend I see coming is the need to be more multi- and inter-disciplinary as designers or technology. As Ethan Kaplan
%a{ :href => "http://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2008/08/16/the-bottom-15-up-from-0/" }
pointed out
, effective web design should no longer be constrained to just IE and Firefox in a desktop environment. That means we have to think more clearly about what our applications do, why they do each thing, and how each “feature” we add, offers value in different settings or context.
%p
Sites and apps that don’t adapt to that reality are going to suffer some severe custom service issues.
%p
So says I.

What are the three things online that are exciting you most?
%p
Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr - I think what really excites me about these is that there are so many great web apps you can use to work with them. I know nothing about back-end development but I can still create my own mashups thanks to all the apps that spin off these great social computing tools.
%ul
%li
What gadget do you never leave home without? And given most everybody will say their phone or their laptop, why?
%p
My macbook pro. I feel like its a never ending game of catchup trying to learn and keep up with new web technologies so if I’m not on my laptop experimenting, designing, or reading or writing a blog post, I feel like I’m missing out on learning something new and stretching myself. I do think its good to have web free weekends every now and then though!
%ul
%li
What will be the Next Big Thing?
%p
I think increased emergence of social computing and location based tools. With an improvement in our broadband and wireless coverage (I hope), being online will be a constant, and seamless interaction with the web wherever you are on whatever device will exist.

  Jamis’s page on git
for the kind of page backpack is perfect for.
%li
%a{ :href => "http://wufoo.com/" }
  Wufoo
\- Ridiculously east to use and again “just enough” for most of your online data-gathering needs.
%li
%a{ :href => "http://github.com" }
  GitHub
\- Really lowers the bar for sharing your “still incubating” open source projects that were never worth setting up an svn server for. Checkout all the
%a{ :href => "http://github.com/search?q=dotfiles" }
  dotfiles repositories
for a great example of the git+github sweetspot.
%p
Gadget: typing this on an
%a{ :href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC" }
eee pc
from a bar in Dublin, the keyboard takes considerable time to get used to but once your over that hump the 5 hours battery makes a huge difference to the amount places your willing to pull a laptop. Better battery life will be the next big thing in laptops.
%p
Next big thing: better wireless infrastructure. Wifi gets more ubiquitous every day but its reliability hasn’t improved nearly as rapidly. When it works its awesome but it still doesn’t feel like the “internet” in terms of speed and reliability.

Just thought of something else for #1. Twine.com, it’s in Beta at the moment but looks very promising. Not sure if anyone mentioned it already. And after reading everyone’s comments made me think more about #3 and besides the web becoming more intelligent and open I think we’ll see/ are seeing a move to total online database sharing across different programs/apps, so there will be a total focus on how users retrieve information as there is currently an overload of data out there.
