If I’m reading the website correctly it appears as though the standard edition carries advertising, whilst it’s an option to turn on/off on the pro/carrier models.

Also, it’s nice to see a company that’s put some effort into developing a quality product with quality supporting components like the site and online dashboard/console, the packaging etc … something that seems to be fading with the new beta fad where stuff gets thrown onto the Internet half-baked. I understand that innovation moves quicker now and there isn’t time to sit on an idea for too long or risk losing it to a competitor … nonetheless, these guys are showing you can successfully implement an idea and do it properly.

I joined FON a little over a year ago and have been really happy with it. I don’t use that network at home as I already have a beefed-up Linksys I use for internal stuff, but I have been giving neighbors, friends, and such access to the FON router’s public signal and I have used other FON routers while traveling. I like the service so much, I’m considering buying about 50 of the routers to give out to neighbors to create true community WiFi.
%p
I hadn’t really heard much about Meraki until your post, but I may look into them as another option.

Can the advertising bar be turned off on the standard edition? I don’t want every site I view to have that superimposed or wedged in.
%p
Apart  from that, this is a product that I’ve waited years to see. If I had money, I’d order instantly.
%p
The other thing I expect to see one day is peer-to-peer mesh on mobile phones, whether over wifi or even if phones could be persuaded to communicate directly with each other using the network frequencies and protocols.

Lachlan: great post, us Perth peeps are organising our own Meraki Mob for over here (though it probably won’t join up much…), should be an order going in soon.
%p
andrew barnett: check out Terranet in Sweden (http://www.terranet.se ), which is doing exactly what you’re talking about (with wifi and also current phone spectrum), though their product is only in early prototype phase and they only share information with “business partners” at this stage.

Serdar, the free tier has a small toolbar at the top for messaging and, yes, advertisements. In Standard you can’t turn that off - but your private tier (for your personal use) won’t have that
%p
Nat, you can limit speeds (both up and down) for the various tiers. You can also block bandwidth hogs. You can’t automatically limit them yet, but I’ve had 32 users in the past few months and I’ve never come close to hitting my 20Gb limit…
%p
I’ve already got over a dozen orders coming in so we can save on postage. Ping me at lachlan@lachstock.com.au if you want in on the savings!
%p
Otherwise you can go the brave route like Nick Hodge and pony up yourself. You’ll get them a bit quicker

Repeaters? Are you kidding me? Do you realize how slow a network would be if it relied on repeaters all over the town? And we’re talking about cheap ones here. Nice dream but there’s no way you can get any decent speed/bandwidth on a network if you just put repeaters all over the place.

how does the idea of sharing your bandwidth/connection jibe with some ISP’s terms and conditions (namely not reselling/subletting bandwidth)?

Thanks for that injection of ‘can do’ attitude, Christian! I’m sure we’ll work something out
%p
Glad you’re interested, Mike. Let’s free NZ too! ;)
%p
It’s a good question, Patrick. If your contract states that kind of thing then they’d probably argue that giving it away for free is against their terms of service.
%p
I think many short-sighted ISPs would argue that
%p
I don’t have enough money to back everybody up if they tell their ISP to go jump, but I’ll say this. I don’t reckon they’ll notice for a while. Probably a significant amount of time
%p
I’m not going to worry about it for now. I looked for such a clause in my contract
and couldn’t find one, but that’s pretty irrelevant given that all such contracts all the provider to change the terms as they please
%p
The other thing I’d say is that I’d love for folks who have first-hand knowledge of such clauses, or who are contacted by their ISPs about this stuff, to share that knowledge with the rest of us. Forewarned is fore-armed and all that ;)

Meraki experience.
%p
Hi, I thought I would share my experience with Meraki OUtdoor. I have two and fitted them with a 10Dbi omni-direction antenna, and then used Netsumbler to work out its maximum range. I got about 600m as the working average but the signal was definately no good at working its way around trees or buildings. The antenna I have is mounted on the roof of the house about 6m above the natural ground level and it is entirely flat country around me. To improve the signal to the 1km to 8km touted either requires a directional antenna or the addition of an amplified to increase the signal from 200mW. I think 4W is the maximum that you are allowed to use at home. There are a couple of calculators that will allow you to make an theoretical estimate of range.

I have ordered 3 meraki mini outdoor units for use in adelaide. I am interested in modifying them – however Meraki has changed their EULA to ban modifying the software.
%p
Can a product that is based on GPL code be allowed to have this clause?
%p
Doesn’t that interfere with the “Freedom to Tinker” right the GNU Public License grants us?
%p
I am interested to see if any other meraki users in australia have modified their units.

Hi to every body.
This is all great to hear that you can get free Internet excess. One thing i don’t understand if it’s free Internet why does the one that controls the network charges other users to have access. That not FREE. You still have to have Internet provider to have connection to Internet and you have limited megabytes of download. I don’t understand, if you have users using the network to excess Internet before you know it you have reached you limit on downloading.
How does one install Meraki minis. Do you have to have Meraki mini for every individual computer in that case each users has to by one, but when you go buy one you are advised to buy two. You are trying to promote a product that is not clear. Not everybody is computer literate and most people don’t really want to read 2000 pages of information on a product. Make it simple use an example of connecting other computers to the network and please by all means illustrations is the best way to go. I went to Meraki site and I could not find any simple information about this  product. They can scream and say how great this is and if we all do it together we can change the way Internet is. For god sakes tell us what the fuss is about in simple language.
