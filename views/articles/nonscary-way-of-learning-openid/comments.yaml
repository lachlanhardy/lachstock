        <p>What about non-geek types? It all sounds pretty complicated for the standard web user.</p>
        <p>Is this the case? … and how will that impact the mainstream adoption of OpenID?</p>

        <p>@Nic Fair call. People have been asking for it in SimpleLog for nearly a year, but no dice. I got cracking this morning, so we&rsquo;ll see how long that takes me ;)</p>
        <p>@Scott The user experience is OpenID&rsquo;s single biggest issue. It shouldn&rsquo;t be as hard as it is.</p>
        <p>I reckon it&rsquo;s mostly due to complexity. For folks to be convinced that it is a good idea, they want to know some things about it and explanations get complicated very very quickly. In terms of actually just using it, it&rsquo;s easy. The problem is convincing folks to use it.</p>
        <p>I think <a href="https://myvidoop.com/">myVidoop&rsquo;s</a> video explanation is one of the best, but it still gets way too jargonistic after a while: <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=xcmY8Pk-qEk">OpenID according to Dave</a>.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve poked about looking for an answer to this one but so far nothing definitive… are there any issues delegating more than one URL back to a single openid?</p>
        <p>Obviously each extra URL is one more site to “keep safe” but otherwise it seems ok to me; but then I don&rsquo;t know if openid servers will chuck a wobbly if more than one site gets delegated.</p>
        <p>Thoughts?</p>
