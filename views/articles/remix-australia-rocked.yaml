Thanks a lot, DG! I had a ball.

Thanks very much, Bronwen! I’m really glad you enjoyed it. We all have a dark side - I’m sure yours is equally impressive, but I’m happy to run with the nice one!

Hey there,
%p
Just wanted to say you guys turned what I thought would be a massively boring session into one that really rocked. Whilst, sure, you didn’t sway me towards using IE8 all that much, you definetly taught me a thing or two about web standards and making my websites much better, both from a development pov and a design one.
%p
Out of all of the sessions that day, yours made the biggest impression on me, and not just because it was in a platform I could understand, but also because you both presented it in a forward, honest method.
%p
So thanks for the awesome session!
%p
Regards,

That’s fantastic, David, thanks very much! I’m glad we were able make an impression. I’m only sorry we didn’t have more time left for your questions (which were not git-ish in the slightest).
%p
Feel free to hit me up with any further questions!

Did your IE8 talk mention the IE8b

CSS bugs
?

A much improved rendering engine, just a few bugs to iron out.

I may one day turn up at one of those web conferences.

BTW, how is Sydney life. I live just up the freeway from you on the sunny Central Coast.
