        <p>You gave a fantastic presentation, a brilliant end to the conference which only as good as it was due to all the great presenters who came on board.</p>
        <p>I really hope we see more local governments adopting the Open Web philosophy and maybe we&rsquo;ll see an API available before too long!</p>
        <p>Thanks so much for being apart of our conference, Diana</p>
        <p>P.S I&rsquo;ll let you know as soon as the podcast is up!</p>

        <p>Thanks for the kind words and a great prezo from you also!</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve drifted from the more technical side of standards for a while, so it was a great return to my &lsquo;old roots&rsquo;. Good for me to reconnect with a kindred web spirit.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately this is going to come across as biased, but honestly, Lachlan&rsquo;s presentation was the best I&rsquo;ve seen in ages.</p>
        <p>Make the time to watch it, it&rsquo;s worth it. You will not ask for your 50 minutes back.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed your presentation Lachlan. I look forward to the day when we get to implement more of the open web technologies in Aussie government.</p>
        <p>Great capture of John&rsquo;s quotes - I particularly love the second one&#133;</p>

        <p>Lisa, you don&rsquo;t sound biased to me at all. Please, tell me more.</p>

        <p>hey there - i&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with local (or any) government - but its a generic topic, with extra pertinence to .gov. &amp;  you crystallized this issue nicely for me. thanks mate.</p>

        <p>Great preso mate. Makes me miss the passion of the Sydney scene which, believe me, is world world class.</p>
