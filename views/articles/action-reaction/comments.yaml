        <p>Whilst I’m still in awe of those crazy people that seem to always be on, I’ve definately had to invoke some similar ideas to get rid of distractions whilst trying to get work done.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn off email/twitter/blog readers etc etc for blocks of time. I’ve found I can work on a project for about two hours before shiny things start distracting me. After the block, then I check emails</li>
            <li>Only respond to email that is urgent right away. I find there is a significant context switch to respond to correspondence properly. If a client has to wait two hours to get a response, the world isn’t going to end.</li>
            <li>Down time. I used to feel guilty for sitting in front of the couch watching mindless tv, then realised I need to switch off your brain. Hanging out with mates for coffee/drinks has the same effect.</li>
            <li>Make time your our own stuff (I suck at this). This gives you time to actually act, otherwise your spend your whole time spinning your wheels.</li>
            <li>Pick one social network - I only use Twitter (I don’t count sites that have social networks tacked on like flickr), I don’t bother trying to dilute my attention with facebook, plurk etc etc.</li>
            <li>Oh, your bang on the money with talking to smart people - they provide inspiration, and that is what drives people to act.</li>
        </ol>

I definitely need to cull some of the crap (both in quantity and frequency) from my life … it’s all getting in the way of me actually Getting Shit Done.
%p
You’re right about keeping in the loop - it doesn’t work how you expect it to but you don’t realise that till you think about the content of that loop and how irrelevant and useless most of it is. Socially, might be interesting … but I’ve got places to go! :-)

100%, done it already, kill the distraction, reduced feeds, only have a core of SNS, more away from the net time. Like no mobile access.
%p
The interesting one is the need to fill the silent brain with activity.  I still get this, that where for me music helps, it washes over the mental me, bringing new ideas and concepts.   I’ve still not found away to silence the 100’s of ideas that flood around all the time.
%p
Then like you say the need to push yourself to exhaustion, why we do this is a good question.  Maybe we are just trying to prove to ourselves a false level of expectation.

A friend emailed me to point out that Bruce Lee already said it all (and much better than I did!)

Down time is definitely vital, but I’m finding that I need to structure it. Random downtime doesn’t help because then I just stress about everything I think I

should
be doing!

I’m hoping that pushing the reactive part of my day to the afternoon will leave me clear to do ‘my own things’ in the morning - whether they’re work-related or not doesn’t matter - I just want to do things that I actually planned to do.

Haven’t you become tired of twitter yet. One Australian to another. Come back to earth. Kill the signal. :-)

Alan, it’s only the noise I want to kill. You’re assuming that there is no worthwhile content on Twitter. That depends on who you choose to follow and how many!
%p
I prune Twitter frequently and ruthlessly. I only wish I were as ruthless with my feeds, but I’m getting there.
