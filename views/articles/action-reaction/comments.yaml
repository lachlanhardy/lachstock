        <p>Whilst I&rsquo;m still in awe of those crazy people that seem to always be on, I&rsquo;ve definately had to invoke some similar ideas to get rid of distractions whilst trying to get work done.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn off email/twitter/blog readers etc etc for blocks of time. I&rsquo;ve found I can work on a project for about two hours before shiny things start distracting me. After the block, then I check emails</li>
            <li>Only respond to email that is urgent right away. I find there is a significant context switch to respond to correspondence properly. If a client has to wait two hours to get a response, the world isn&rsquo;t going to end.</li>
            <li>Down time. I used to feel guilty for sitting in front of the couch watching mindless tv, then realised I need to switch off your brain. Hanging out with mates for coffee/drinks has the same effect.</li>
            <li>Make time your our own stuff (I suck at this). This gives you time to actually act, otherwise your spend your whole time spinning your wheels.</li>
            <li>Pick one social network - I only use Twitter (I don&rsquo;t count sites that have social networks tacked on like flickr), I don&rsquo;t bother trying to dilute my attention with facebook, plurk etc etc.</li>
            <li>Oh, your bang on the money with talking to smart people - they provide inspiration, and that is what drives people to act.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I definitely need to cull some of the crap (both in quantity and frequency) from my life … it&rsquo;s all getting in the way of me actually Getting Shit Done.</p>
        <p>You&rsquo;re right about keeping in the loop - it doesn&rsquo;t work how you expect it to but you don&rsquo;t realise that till you think about the content of that loop and how irrelevant and useless most of it is. Socially, might be interesting … but I&rsquo;ve got places to go! :-)</p>

        <p>100%, done it already, kill the distraction, reduced feeds, only have a core of SNS, more away from the net time. Like no mobile access.</p>
        <p>The interesting one is the need to fill the silent brain with activity.  I still get this, that where for me music helps, it washes over the mental me, bringing new ideas and concepts.   I&rsquo;ve still not found away to silence the 100&rsquo;s of ideas that flood around all the time.</p>
        <p>Then like you say the need to push yourself to exhaustion, why we do this is a good question.  Maybe we are just trying to prove to ourselves a false level of expectation.</p>

        <p>A friend emailed me to point out that Bruce Lee already said it all (and much better than I did!)</p>
        <p>Down time is definitely vital, but I&rsquo;m finding that I need to structure it. Random downtime doesn&rsquo;t help because then I just stress about everything I think I <em>should</em> be doing!</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m hoping that pushing the reactive part of my day to the afternoon will leave me clear to do &lsquo;my own things&rsquo; in the morning - whether they&rsquo;re work-related or not doesn&rsquo;t matter - I just want to do things that I actually planned to do.</p>

        <p>Haven&rsquo;t you become tired of twitter yet. One Australian to another. Come back to earth. Kill the signal. :-)</p>

        <p>Alan, it&rsquo;s only the noise I want to kill. You&rsquo;re assuming that there is no worthwhile content on Twitter. That depends on who you choose to follow and how many!</p>
        <p>I prune Twitter frequently and ruthlessly. I only wish I were as ruthless with my feeds, but I&rsquo;m getting there.</p>
