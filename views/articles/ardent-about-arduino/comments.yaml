I’m stoked to see that
a) you’re into this Lach
and
b) there’s going to be a workshop down here in Melbourne!

Wow that looks cool! I can’t program, but it looks like a stack of fun.

Are there a lot of experimental projects evolving out of Arduino?

This kind of stuff all looks so cool. Lego has been doing this kind of stuff for ages with Robolab. You can start by making apps visually in Robolab but there’s also a Java API that hooks into everything, the robots have engines, different kinds of sensors, etc. It would be a great thing to give young children but for the software programmer, it’s extremely cool to see physical results of your code.

I think it’s time I moved to Sydney or Melbourne, where all the action is.

Thanks for the discount code, Marcus! Very cool :)
%p
You’d be very welcome in Sydney, Jim! But don’t you have that little degree thing to finish? ;)
%p
Thanks for the links, Rob!
