        <p>Cheers!  I know exactly how you feel.  Same thing happened to me at SXSWi2005.  In almost the exact same way…Flickr account, addiction, blog, first post, not knowing what I’d write about…but damn sure that I wasn’t just going to take…that I must know something that I could give back.</p>
        <p>So…thanks for joining the conversation and giving us a view that is uniquely Lach.</p>
