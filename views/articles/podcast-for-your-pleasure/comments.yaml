  Aaaahhh I’m sorry about the “mic falling off” bit - I thought it was best left in, it will make people feel like there were really there!
  (Anyhow, I left in my tongue-tied “read-write-web” - try and say that 3 times quickly!)

  Seriously though, really great to see the presentation again, it sinks in more the second time, and its a great resource to show people and encourage others to take part in building an Open Web.

  I think the moment you start to like 1) your own voice or 2) watching yourself present on a video then it might be time to start applying for the likes of Big Brother and Australian Idol…

  It’s never easy and I share your pain. I never listen to my own podcasts!

  Looking good though, I have only made it 20min through so far. Very engaging topics and a good wrap-up to the day I am sure.

  That’s cool, Di, I wasn’t expecting you to edit it out. And I’m glad you were enthusiastic enough about the topic to sit through it a second time!

  Good point, Scott, but I was hoping you would be joining me for Big Brother 2012: Random Web Peep Edition…
