        <p>Nice one! I saw you create the repository the other day and wondered what would grow within it.</p>
        <p>I’ve got a feature request/suggestion. How about ajaxy pagination between commits? Ordered by date I suppose.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I extracted it from my Lachstock code. Which means we lost the history, but that’s cool.</p>
        <p>Sweet idea! Should definitely add that.</p>
