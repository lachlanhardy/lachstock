  %p I&rsquo;m a coder, a consultant, an organiser, a talker and a doer.

  %p I work at <a href="http://atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> where my job is to bring usable functional design into all their products and web philosophies into their thinking. (By the way, it&rsquo;s incredibly unlikely that anything I say should be taken as representing an official Atlassian viewpoint.)

  %p One of the team behind the <a href="http://webjam.com.au/">Webjam</a> events, I&rsquo;m very keen on promoting innovation and helping people push the boundaries of the web.

  %p I&rsquo;m available for freelance consulting and coding as long as your project is entirely amazing and you want it rock even harder.

  %p I&rsquo;m also available for coffees, beers, and crazy fantastical web-dreaming discussion.
