%h1= @title

%p I’m a coder, a consultant, an organiser, a talker and a doer.

%p I work at <a href="http://atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> where my job is to bring usable functional design into all their products and web philosophies into their thinking. (By the way, it’s incredibly unlikely that anything I say should be taken as representing an official Atlassian viewpoint.)

%p One of the team behind the <a href="http://webjam.com.au/">Webjam</a> events, I’m very keen on promoting innovation and helping people push the boundaries of the web.

%p I’m available for freelance consulting and coding as long as your project is entirely amazing and you want it rock even harder.

%p I’m also available for coffees, beers, and crazy fantastical web-dreaming discussion.
